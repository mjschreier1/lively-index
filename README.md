# LiveLy - Your Apartment Management Portal

## The Pitch
I have lived in apartments for the last ten years across a few different states. I've noticed that apartment portals (where they exist) are often clunky and do not render well on mobile devices. Further, they often could stand an upgrade to the UX design. After conversing with others, I realize that I am not the only person to notice this problem. Apartment management portals are often clunky and do not render well on mobile devices. LiveLy seeks to disrupt that norm.

LiveLy is a community calendar, a service request portal, a conference room reservation desk, and a resident payment portal.
