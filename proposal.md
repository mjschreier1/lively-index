## Capstone Proposal

### Project Description
Does your apartment community have an out-of-date resident portal that's hard to navigate? Is it overly cumbersome to use on a mobile device? That's where LiveLy comes in. LiveLy is a progressive community portal web application that changes all of that. Easily pay your rent securely through Stripe, submit service requests, book conference rooms, and more, all from your desktop OR mobile device.

### Problem statement
Many apartment communities do not have attractive, functional resident portals that are mobile-ready. Many that do are difficult to navigate and could use a boost in the quality of UX design.

### How will your project solve this problem?
LiveLy is a progressive web app that is responsive and adaptive to user media with a clean user interface. Its minimalist design makes for a clear, simple user experience.

### Map the user experience
- Bill is a resident at Desination Ridge Apartments. When it's time to pay his rent each month, Bill navigates to the portal, clicks on "Payments" to view his balance, and enters his ACH credentials and email address for a secure payment to Stripe. Within a few minutes, an email receipt is sent to his provided email address for his records. 

- When Bill has a leak, he navigates to the portal, clicks on "Service" to view his open and closed service requests, and clicks the "plus" icon to submit a new service request. He fills out a short form and clicks submit. Within a few minutes, an email confirmation is sent to his provided email address as well. He can continue to visit the "Service" window to view updates from management.

- Bill hosts a cribbage party on the first Wednesday, and prefers to utilize a conference space. He reserves his room by visiting the portal, clicking on "Reserve Rooms" and filling out a short form. Again, he will receive an email confirmation within a few minutes.

- Dave is a community manager. On the first of the month, he can visit the admin portal and click "Payments" to view a financial report detailing rent payments. He can also log into his Stripe dashboard to cash out payments to the community account.

- Dave can also view all service requests and input updates by visiting the admin portal and clicking "Service Requests".
